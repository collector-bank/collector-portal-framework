# Typography

Our typographic components are simple to use as they are close to the completely standard HTML counterparts.

## Props

| Component  | Props                |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| H1         | `centered?`: boolean |
| H2         | `centered?`: boolean |
| H3         | `centered?`: boolean |
| Text       | None                 |
| TextLink   | None                 |

## Example
```jsx
<H1>A heading</H1>
<H2>A smaller centered heading</H2>
<Text>A paragraph of text</Text>
```
