# Typography

Our typographic components are simple to use as they are close to the completely standard HTML counterparts.

## Props

| Component  | Props |
| ---------- | ----  |
| H1         |       |
| H2         |       |
| H3         |       |
| Text       |       |
| TextLink   |       |

## Example
```jsx
<H1>A heading</H1>
<H2>A smaller centered heading</H2>
<Text>A paragraph of text</Text>
```
